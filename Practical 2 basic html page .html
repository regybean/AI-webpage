        <h1>AI's contribution to society</h1>
        <ul class = "list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item">Artificial intelligence can dramatically improve the efficiencies of our workplaces and can augment the work humans can do. When AI takes over repetitive or dangerous tasks, it frees up the human workforce to do work they are better equipped for—tasks that involve creativity and empathy among others. If people are doing work that is more engaging for them, it could increase happiness and job satisfaction.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Prosthetics are big money. They cost a fortune to make and are a necessary item for anyone missing a limb who wants to have a decent quality of life. Many prosthetics rely on passive technology, which means that they provide no feedback and don’t automatically adjust their functionality to accommodate personal needs. All that has changed in recent years as scientists such as Hugh Herr have created active prosthetics that can simulate the actions of real limbs and automatically adjust to the person using them. Even though Hugh Herr grabbed major headlines, you can find active technology in all sorts of prosthetics today, including knees, arms, and hands.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Medical monitoring can help patients receive care faster after a major incident and even predict when a patient will have a major incident, such as a heart attack. Most of these devices, especially those that are predictive in nature, rely on an AI of some sort to perform the work. However, the question of whether these devices provide a financial incentive for the people creating and using them remains.
              Studies are hard to come by, but remote monitoring of heart patients saves considerable medical costs (besides helping the patient live a happier, longer life). In fact, according to Financial Times, the use of remote monitoring, even for healthy people, has a significant impact on medical costs (the article requires a subscription to read). The impact of the savings is so high that remote monitoring is actually changing how medicine works.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Robots are a significant driving force behind AI. Robots are becoming a reliable, accessible, and known technology with a visible presence and a track record of success, which is why so many organizations are investing in even more advanced robots.
            Many existing traditional businesses rely on robots today, which is something many people may not know. For example, the oil industry relies heavily on robots to search for new oil sources, perform maintenance, and inspect pipes. In some cases, robots also make repairs in places that humans can’t easily access; such as in pipes. According to Oil & Gas Monitor, AI makes it possible to interpolate between mining models, reduce drilling costs, and perform simulations that demonstrate potential drilling issues. Using AI enables engineers to reduce overall risk, which means that oil will also have a potentially smaller environmental impact because of fewer spills.</li> 
          <li class="list-group-item">Human vision doesn’t see the broad spectrum of light that actually exists in nature. And even with augmentation, humans struggle to think at a very small scale or a very large scale. Biases keep humans from seeing the unexpected. Sometimes a random pattern actually has structure, but humans can’t see it. An AI can see what humans can’t see and then act upon it. For example, when looking for stresses in metal, an AI can see the potential for fatigue and act upon it. The cost savings can be monumental when dealing with items such as waveguides, which are used for radio transmission.</li>
